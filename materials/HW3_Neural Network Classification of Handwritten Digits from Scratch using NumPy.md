# HW3: Neural Network Classification of Handwritten Digits from Scratch using NumPy

## Summary
For Homework 3, the assignment is to classify the MNIST handwritten digits dataset using a two-layer neural network implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy. Students are not allowed to use scikit-learn; instead, they must use NumPy to implement the neural network. The task involves developing and training the neural network model, including implementing forward and backward propagation steps, as well as the training process. The output of the assignment should include performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, along with any additional insights gained during the analysis. Hand-in requirements include submitting a PDF document containing the results and a zip file containing the code implementation, ensuring that the implementation is shared appropriately.

## Requirements
- Task: Classify the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
